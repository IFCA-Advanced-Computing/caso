features:
  - |
    Add per-messenger configuration to control which record types are published.
    Each messenger can now be configured with a ``record_types`` option in its
    ``[messenger_<name>]`` section to specify which record types it should receive.
    Valid record types are: ``cloud``, ``ip``, ``accelerator``, ``storage``, and
    ``energy``.
  - |
    SSM messengers (``ssm``, ``ssmv4``) now default to publishing only records
    from the default extractors (nova, cinder, neutron): ``cloud``, ``ip``,
    ``accelerator``, and ``storage``. Energy records from the prometheus
    extractor are not published to SSM by default.
  - |
    Other messengers (``noop``, ``logstash``) default to publishing all record
    types.
upgrade:
  - |
    To publish energy records to SSM, you must now explicitly add ``energy`` to
    the ``record_types`` list in the ``[messenger_ssm]`` section::

      [messenger_ssm]
      record_types = cloud,ip,accelerator,storage,energy

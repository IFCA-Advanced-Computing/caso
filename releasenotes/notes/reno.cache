    - "Add multi-region support in order to extract information from several \nregions\
      \ through different configuration files.\n"
  releasenotes/notes/new-release-notes-b79c3d7a778fc946.yaml:
    features:
    - 'New IP accounting record is implemented. Now cASO is able to extract IP

      accounting and publish it using its JSON rendering. No new configuration

      needs to be done, but the cASO user needs to have access to the Neutron

      endpoints.

      '
    - "cASO now allows to specity the projects to extract records from as project\n\
      IDs, rather than names. When dealing with different identity domains this\n\
      is troublesome, therefore we need to allow users to specify project IDs \nrather\
      \ than names.\n"
    fixes:
    - Define the correct entrypoints for the V2 and V4 messengers.
    - Generate LOG warnings when mappings cannot be found.
    prelude: 'Starting with this version cASO release notes are published within the
      documentation. This version is a major release that implements IP accounting
      record, as well as several bugfixes. There are no upgrade notes to take into
      account.
